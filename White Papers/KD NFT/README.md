Describe layers.

- TODO
Change layers here

background-->smudgeLayerOne
background-->smudgeLayerTwo
smudgeLayerOne-->accentLayerOne
smudgeLayerTwo-->accentLayerTwo

```

- TODO Change this to match new layers, but keep layout.
- Background
  - The black background has only one instance out of 500, making that NFT the most rare.
  - The color of the background not only influences the composition of the art piece, it is also a factor that determines the overall rarity of the NFT.
- Smudge Layer One
  - This layer consists of smudges in grayish blues, purples, and greens
- Smudge Layer Two
  - This layer consists of smudges in grays
- Accent Layer One
  - This layer consists of accents in gold, green, and pink
- Accent Layer Two
  - This layer consists of accents in various colors

# üè¶ KD NFT Project Meta Economics: The Dual Purpose DAO Governance Token/Stable Coin¬©Ô∏è and NFT Staking TokenSphere¬©Ô∏è
The primary concept driving this project economy will be the use of the Project DAO Governance Token to provide stability, serving a dual purpose and providing exceptional value while doing so.
- The Project Governance Token will double as the Stable Coin, morphing into a hybrid coin, The Dual Purpose DAO Governance Token/Stable Coin¬©Ô∏è
- The DAO Governance Token provides outstanding stability due to the fact that 1 token = 1 vote therefore the peg will be solid

# ü§ù Meet the Team!
    - Currently Knuckle Draggers NFT is a one person project.
<h1 align="center"/>Hi, üëãüèº I'm WrappedUsername</h1> 

![Contribution](https://activity-graph.herokuapp.com/graph?username=WrappedUsername&theme=react-dark&hide_border=true&area=true)

<p align="center" />I am a self-taught blockchain/dapp developer, it was not easy to learn how to code from zero prior knowledge,
but I am a recovered alcoholic so I am desperately trying to rebuild my life, so I never give up and after a year of learning how 
to code I feel more confident about blockchain developement. I still have so much to learn, and a developer should always be 
learning new skills thats why I love being a developer I love exploring new ideas and learning new developer skills.</p>

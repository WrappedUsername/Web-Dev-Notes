# Foam Chunk Smudge NFT: 📃 White Paper - 🚧 Work In Progress 🏗
- 500 Abstract Art Pieces
- Deployed to layer 2 Polygon Mainnet

The digital art program I like to use has a digital "brush" I am fond of, and I have named this project after these digital brushes.
The very large image size of 3840 x 3840 that I decided to use has created a few small issues:
- namely that the individual file size is enormous (issues with loading the large image), 
- that also limited my ability to create a token supply more than 500,
- because there was a 25GB upload limit,

but these issues with the large image size just goes to show that NFT's can have more utility and value beyond a digital art piece stored in a file.

- Background

The black background has only one instance out of 500, making that NFT the most rare.
The color of the background not only influences the composition of the art piece, it is also a factor that determines the overall rarity of the NFT.

# 🚀 FCS Project Tokenomics & Distribution
- FCS ERC-20 Staking Reward Utility Token is pegged to the FCS DAO GT/SC
  - The rate of inflation will be relative to the supply of FCS DAO GT/SC
  - The burning of tokens to purchase FCS DAO GT/SC will act as a deflationary event
  - The burning of tokens to purchase Special FCS NFT Access Pass will act as a deflationary event
  - Low supply of FCS DAO GT/SC will result in high inflation to encourage adoption and reward early investors
  - High supply of FCS DAO GT/SC will result in low inflation to encourage a stable project economy

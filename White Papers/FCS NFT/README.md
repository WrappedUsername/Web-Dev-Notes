The digital art program I like to use has a digital "brush" I am fond of, and I have named this project after these digital brushes.
The very large image size of 3840 x 3840 that I decided to use has created a few small issues:
- namely that the individual file size is enormous (issues with loading the large image), 
- that also limited my ability to create a token supply more than 500,
- because there was a 25GB upload limit,

but these issues with the large image size just goes to show that NFT's can have more utility and value beyond a digital art piece stored in a file.

# 💎 Rarity and Traits

- 5 seperate layers

```

- Background

The black background has only one instance out of 500, making that NFT the most rare.
The color of the background not only influences the composition of the art piece, it is also a factor that determines the overall rarity of the NFT.

<h1 align="center"/>Hi, 👋🏼 I'm WrappedUsername</h1> 
<p align="center" />I am a self-taught blockchain/dapp developer, it was not easy to learn how to code from zero prior knowledge,
but I am a recovered alcoholic so I am desperately trying to rebuild my life, so I never give up and after a year of learning how 
to code I feel more confident about blockchain developement. I still have so much to learn, and a developer should always be 
learning new skills thats why I love being a developer I love exploring new ideas and learning new developer skills.</p>

```JavaScript
- 500 Abstract Art Pieces
- Deployed to layer 2 Polygon Mainnet
```

The digital art program I like to use has a digital "brush" I am fond of, and I have named this project after these digital brushes.
The very large image size of 3840 x 3840 that I decided to use has created a few small issues:
- namely that the individual file size is enormous (issues with loading the large image), 
- that also limited my ability to create a token supply more than 500,
- because there was a 25GB upload limit,

but these issues with the large image size just goes to show that NFT's can have more utility and value beyond a digital art piece stored in a file.


# 💎 Rarity and Traits

- 5 seperate layers

background-->smudgeLayerOne
background-->smudgeLayerTwo
smudgeLayerOne-->accentLayerOne
smudgeLayerTwo-->accentLayerTwo

```

- Background
  - The black background has only one instance out of 500, making that NFT the most rare.
  - The color of the background not only influences the composition of the art piece, it is also a factor that determines the overall rarity of the NFT.
- Smudge Layer One
  - This layer consists of smudges in grayish blues, purples, and greens
- Smudge Layer Two
  - This layer consists of smudges in grays
- Accent Layer One
  - This layer consists of accents in gold, green, and pink
- Accent Layer Two
  - This layer consists of accents in various colors

# 🏦 FCS NFT Project Meta Economics: The Dual Purpose DAO Governance Token/Stable Coin©️ and NFT Staking TokenSphere©️
The primary concept driving this project economy will be the use of the Project DAO Governance Token to provide stability, serving a dual purpose and providing exceptional value while doing so.
- The Project Governance Token will double as the Stable Coin, morphing into a hybrid coin, The Dual Purpose DAO Governance Token/Stable Coin©️
- The DAO Governance Token provides outstanding stability due to the fact that 1 token = 1 vote therefore the peg will be solid

# 🤝 Meet the Team!
Currently Foam Chunk Smudge NFT is a one person project.
<h1 align="center"/>Hi, 👋🏼 I'm WrappedUsername</h1> 
<p align="center" />I am a self-taught blockchain/dapp developer, it was not easy to learn how to code from zero prior knowledge,
but I am a recovered alcoholic so I am desperately trying to rebuild my life, so I never give up and after a year of learning how 
to code I feel more confident about blockchain developement. I still have so much to learn, and a developer should always be 
learning new skills thats why I love being a developer I love exploring new ideas and learning new developer skills.</p>

How the world's decentralized computer works:
```

- The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) is very similar to a virtual machine on your personal computer,
  - in that it is software imitating, actual dedicated hardware, but in reality,
  
## 💻 The host machine must share  
  - a virtual machine is simply sharing the host computer's dedicated hardware,
    - a virtual machine is allocated certain amounts of usage, usually a percentage of that particular resource,

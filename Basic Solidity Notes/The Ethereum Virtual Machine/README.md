How the world's decentralized computer works:
```

- The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) is very similar to a virtual machine on your personal computer,
  - in that it is software imitating, actual dedicated hardware, but in reality,
  
## 💻 The host machine must share  
  - a virtual machine is simply sharing the host computer's dedicated hardware,
    - a virtual machine is allocated certain amounts of usage, usually a percentage of that particular resource,
    
```yml
Each image of a virtual machine has:
```

- CPU
- RAM
- Storage
- and a Network Interface

```yml
The EVM has:
```

- CPU
  - The Instruction Set uses basic data types ( booleans, integers, addresses, etc.) to come to, a consensus as to how, and what the world's CPU computes 
- RAM 
  - Memory is  
- Storage
- and a Network Interface

## The OSI and TCP/IP model.
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a standardised model which is used to demonstrate the theory behind computer networking.
In practice, it's actually the more compact TCP/IP model that real-world networking is based off of.
| OSI Model | TCP/IP Model |
| --- | :---: |
| Application |              
| Presentation | Application |
| Session |                  
| Transport | Transport |
| Network | Internet | 
| Data Link | 
| Physical | Network Interface |

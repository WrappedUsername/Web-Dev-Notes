## Collection of notes from my self taught developer journey.
### Compound assignments += -= *= /= e.g. JavaScript, Solidity etc.
```JavaScript
/// @notice augmented addition
const myVariable += 2;
/// @notice augmented subtraction
const myVariable -= 2;
/// @notice augmented multiplication
const myVariable *= 2;
/// @notice augmented division
const myVariable /= 2;
```

# More HTML tags

```yml
The meta tag is: 
```

- An HTML element that is used to provide metadata about a web page. 
- Metadata is information about the page that is not directly displayed on the page itself, but is used by search engines, browsers, and other tools to understand the content and context of the page.

```yml
The meta tag is placed inside the head element of the HTML document, and typically takes the following form:
```

```HTML
<head>
<meta name="keyword" content="value">
</head>  
```
- The name attribute specifies the name of the metadata, and the content attribute specifies the value of the metadata.
  - There are many different types of metadata that you can include in a web page using the meta tag. 

```yml
Some common examples include:
```

- description: A brief description of the content of the page, which is often used by search engines as the snippet of text that appears in search results.
- keywords: A list of keywords that are relevant to the content of the page, which is used by search engines to understand the content of the page and improve its ranking in search results.
- viewport: A set of instructions for how the page should be displayed on mobile devices, including the width and scale of the page.
- charset: The character encoding of the page, which specifies how special characters and symbols should be displayed.

```yml
Here is an example of a meta tag that includes a description and a list of keywords:
```

```HTML
<meta name="description" content="This is a description of the web page.">
<meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">
```
The meta tag is an important tool for providing additional information about a web page that is not visible to users, but is used by search engines and other tools to understand and index the page.

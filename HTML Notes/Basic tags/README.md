# Basic HTML tags

- The <!DOCTYPE> tag is an instruction that tells the web browser which version of HTML the page is written in. 
  - It is not an HTML tag per se, but a declaration that appears at the very top of an HTML document, before the <html> tag.

The <!DOCTYPE> tag is important because it helps the browser to interpret the content of the web page correctly and render it properly. Different versions of HTML have different syntax and rules, and the <!DOCTYPE> tag helps the browser to identify which version of HTML to use when rendering the page.

```yml  
Here is an example of a <!DOCTYPE> tag for HTML5:
```  

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
  
This <!DOCTYPE> declaration tells the browser that the page is written in HTML5, the latest version of HTML.

- It's important to include a <!DOCTYPE> tag in your HTML documents to ensure that they are rendered correctly by different browsers. 
  - If you omit the <!DOCTYPE> tag, the browser may render the page in quirks mode, which can lead to differences in how the page is displayed in different browsers.

## Introduction: Choosing the Best Crypto Wallet for You

Today we are doing a deep dive, exploring the best cryptocurrency wallets available or will become available sometime in 2023.

We will also find the safest crypto wallet with the highest level of security, according to the specific features of the wallet. I will show my top picks for the most secure wallets with this trophy. üèÜ 

Crypto wallets are one of the most important technologies when it comes to blockchain technology. With a crypto wallet, you can send and receive cryptocurrencies, but your wallet also holds your NFTs. NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens exist on the Ethereum blockchain and other blockchains like Solana, Tezos, etc. NFTs can be collected and saved in your wallet which is why they need the wallet technology to participate in web3 and blockchain technologies like NFTs.

## Why Do I Need a Crypto Wallet?
To use cryptocurrencies or use web3 technologies, one has to have a crypto wallet. 

A crypto wallet is a software program or physical hardware that stores private/public keys to facilitate the sending and receiving of cryptocurrency. Private keys are stored by the user in various safe locations (hopefully), while public keys are shared with others so they can send funds to your wallet. This is a lot like how PayPal uses your email address as a "public key‚Äù to share with others to send funds over PayPal.

Another vital function your wallet serves is to sign messages or transactions, you will also use your wallet to connect to web3 dApps, like this [NFT minting dApp](https://foam-chunk-smudge.vercel.app/) I built this year.

## How to choose between all the different types of cryptocurrency wallets
```yml
There are a few categories for finding the best type of wallet to store your crypto coins and tokens, those are:
```

- hot wallets
  - online wallet 
    - custodial wallets
  - desktop wallet
    - defi wallets
  - mobile wallet
- cold storage wallets
  - hardware wallets
  - paper wallet

## Hardware Crypto Wallets
Also known as ‚Äúcold storage‚Äù, cryptocurrency hardware wallets, a physical device that stores your private keys and cryptocurrency.

Hardware wallets are considered to be the most secure way of storing your cryptocurrency. Hardware wallets are not connected to the internet, so they can‚Äôt be hacked remotely. With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency, hardware wallets are becoming one of the best ways to store your digital currency. A hardware wallet is a physical device that stores your private keys and public keys on a secure chip. It is like a USB drive with a screen, which you can use to send or receive cryptocurrency.

## Software Crypto Wallets

Also known as ‚Äúhot wallets‚Äù, these can be a mobile app, be a wallet online (usually these are custodial), or a desktop app. 

Software wallets are generally considered less secure than a hardware wallet, but if used correctly they are just as secure as the digital money in your bank down the street. It would take some serious hacking to breaking into a correctly used software wallet.

## Custodial Wallets
Think of centralized trading platforms, not your keys, not your coins. FTX, Terra Luna, etc. a lot of people found out the hard way that when these centralized trading platforms crashed and burned, they froze withdraws and you lost access to your coins in their custodial wallet.

These centralized platforms can also be hacked and there is no regulation for these centralized crypto exchanges to cover you if your assets are lost.

If you are interested in becoming a cryptocurrency trader, you're more than likely thinking of using a centralized exchange, as I am sure we all have. I have used a few centralized platforms myself and although I did not lose any crypto I did get locked out of a couple of them. Decentralized exchanges offer an alternative solution because the trades happen peer-to-peer and the risk of hacking is reduced.

## DeFi Wallet
Your keys, your coins! Most are open-source and you are free to inspect the code if you feel the need to do so. 

## Access your wallet

<img alt="hardware wallet image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104662990/203898777-427c63e2-0f23-4c58-8ed5-651e240daa1e.png">

Bitcoin wallets, Ethereum wallets, do wallets offer multi-blockchain options for storing cryptocurrencies long term while my private keys are completely secure?

Yes, some wallets offer multiple options for storing different cryptocurrencies.

Keeping your secret seed phrase safe and secure is essential to the security of your crypto wallets. While this can be a difficult task, there are many ways you can do it. One way is to make sure that you have the passphrase stored in a fireproof manner, at multiple locations.

## Top Hardware Crypto Wallets

<img alt="hardware wallet image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104662990/203898448-092cf18a-da03-4fbc-8de3-3bef2608e93b.png">

The two most popular types of hardware wallets are the Ledger Nano S and Trezor One.

Hardware wallets are becoming more popular as a storage method for cryptocurrency. There are many types of hardware wallets, but some of the most popular ones are Ledger, Trezor, and KeepKey.

## [Ledger, "one place for all your crypto needs"](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=d83717285958)

## Trezor, "the safe place for your coins"

Was one of the first companies to create a Bitcoin wallet with a screen and they were also one of the first ever to produce a hardware wallet. They were founded in 2013 and they are based in Prague, Czech Republic. Trezor hardware wallets are decent in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency security. 

They claim they are the ultimate in hardware wallet security, but in my honest opinion, that's a bold claim compared to the other wallets on this list, but with that said Trezor wallets never expose your digital asset information to an insecure environment connected to the internet. So their security is not bad at all. 

Trezor supports Bitcoin along with the most resilient & proven cryptocurrencies worldwide, your coins are safe, in your Trezor wallet.

## KeepKey, "the premier wallet"

An American-based company that has been producing hardware wallets since 2015. They are based in Seattle, Washington, KeepKey is the premier wallet in the new ShapeShift Platform, a web-based interface for managing your crypto, now with commission free trading. 
```yml
Stress-Free Security: 
```
Generate and manage your private keys offline in cold storage, guarded against computer vulnerabilities and viruses, while utilizing wallet software for safe transactions.
```yml
Comprehensive Crypto Management:
```
Use ShapeShift's intuitive web-based interface to buy, sell, send, receive, trade, track, and hodl your crypto. Trade for free with FOX tokens. 
Straightforward Backup and Recovery: Each device generates a 12-word recovery sentence during initialization that can be used to retrieve your private keys. Have peace of mind that your funds are secure, even if you lose or break your KeepKey.
```yml
Sleek and Simple Display:
```
The large display gives clarity to every digital asset sent and received on your device. Each transaction must be manually approved using the confirmation button, giving you control and visibility over your transactions.
```yml
Effortless Exchanges:
```

- KeepKey is a USB HID-class device.
- KeepKey generates your Bitcoin private key using its hardware-based random number generator, combined with randomness provided by your computer.
- KeepKey is virus and malware proof; because it does not have an operating system, the layers that viruses, malware, and key loggers infect do not exist on the device.
- Your private key is stored securely on your KeepKey, never leaving the device. Your KeepKey is PIN-protected, which renders it useless even if it falls into the wrong hands.

## üîí Safe and Secure

These may be popular, but are they the most secure with the most advanced, robust security features? When compared to these hardware wallets all others seem to be lacking in the same security features.

What are these security features?

## Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/bsi/articles/best-practices/requirements-engineering/the-common-criteria)

There are seven Evaluation Assurance Levels (EALs). The higher the level, the more confidence you can have that the security functional requirements have been met. 

```yml
The levels are as follows:
```

- EAL1: Functionally Tested. Applies when you require confidence in a product's correct operation, but do not view threats to security as serious. An evaluation at this level should provide evidence that the target of evaluation functions in a manner consistent with its documentation and that it provides useful protection against identified threats.

- EAL2: Structurally Tested. Applies when developers or users require low to moderate independently assured security but the complete development record is not readily available. This situation may arise when there is limited developer access or when there is an effort to secure legacy systems.

- EAL3: Methodically Tested and Checked. Applies when developers or users require a moderate level of independently assured security and require a thorough investigation of the target of evaluation and its development, without substantial reengineering.

- EAL4: Methodically Designed, Tested, and Reviewed. Applies when developers or users require moderate to high independently assured security in conventional commodity products and are prepared to incur additional security-specific engineering costs.

- EAL5: Semi-Formally Designed and Tested. Applies when developers or users require high, independently assured security in a planned development and require a rigorous development approach that does not incur unreasonable costs from specialist security engineering techniques.

- EAL6: Semi-Formally Verified Design and Tested. Applies when developing security targets of evaluation for application in high-risk situations where the value of the protected assets justifies the additional costs.

- EAL7: Formally Verified Design and Tested. Applies to the development of security targets of evaluation for application in extremely high-risk situations, as well as when the high value of the assets justifies the higher costs.

## üèÜ NGRAVE, "eternally yours"

<img alt="hardware wallet image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104662990/204116663-bd3f6077-dcf0-4dd4-82ec-db35978fcbba.png">

With the NGRAVE ZERO you create your keys and sign transactions with a fully offline device, you get state of the art security with an inuitive interface, to me that is extremly important, because if it is too difficult to use, I won't want to learn how to use it, I am busy like everyone else! I don't have time to learn all that.

Plus simple and easy will always be more secure, because there are less mistakes to be made!

```yml
Common Criteria EAL7:
```
- Highest level of security in the blockchain & financial industry, this is a true claim
- Impenetrable by design, anti-tampering protection against physical attacks
- Biometric & light sensor, enhanced security by light, fingerprint & QR scanning
- Generate and protect your keys offline, ZERO is fully "air-gapped", it does not rely on USB or any network connection capability such as WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, or 4G. 
  - All communication takes place via transparent QR codes.

```yml
The 4" touchscreen makes it:
```
- Easy to tap and swipe the huge screen, giving you control over multiple wallets

## üèÜ Arculus, "crypto and NFT security made simple"

<img alt="arculus wallet image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104662990/204362256-7668e82e-d321-40d6-b18b-615ee9fd87db.png">

- EAL6+

## üèÜ [Keystone, "the most powerful hardware wallet"](https://shop.keyst.one/?rfsn=6991939.6a0d16&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=6991939.6a0d16)

<img alt="hardware wallet image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104662990/204116749-7eb8c72e-13f0-4d72-bbed-e5f4a1fbd494.png">

Keystone pioneered the industry's first open source hardware wallet project. All of their hardware and firmware designs are open sourced and available online.

- EAL5+ Secure Element and Open Source
- A proprietary bank-grade secure element which generates fully random numbers, ensuring your crypto assets are stored in a secured way.
- Shamir Backup
  - Keystone supports SLIP39, it enables you to create a Shamir Backup for your recovery phrase.
- Dice Entropy
  - Generate your recovery phrase by manually rolling dices, the manual entropy eliminates all trust dependencies on the Secure Element or PRNG (Pseudorandom Number Generator). This also helps with counteracting against the two greatest risks involved with protecting your recovery seed: Theft & Destruction.
- Verifiable Transactions
  - Keystone decodes the details of a smart contract transaction and re-organizes it into a humanly readable format. This will allow you to verify your transaction within minutes via the device's 4-inch touchscreen and prevent you from signing any malicious transaction. 
- Secure Your Sensitive Information
  - A built-in self-destruction mechanism will activate and thwart any attempts of physical tampering of your device. All sensitive information including your recovery phrase and private keys will be wiped as soon as the device detects any sort of physical dissembling.
- Protection from Supply-Chain Attacks
Supply chain attacks are one of the most serious security threats for hardware wallets because they target vulnerabilities in the logistics process and can happen without anyone's knowledge. Keystone's Web Authentication process will give assurance that your device has not fallen victim to any sort of supply chain attack, for example device tampering.
- Your Shipping Information is Never Revealed
  - They understand how sensitive physical address information can be for crypto hodlers and respect the individual privacy needs of each one of our customers.
- All shipping information is automatically deleted 180 days after your order is placed. You can also request to have it deleted immediately after your device is delivered by contacting them at support@keyst.one

üëç Nice!

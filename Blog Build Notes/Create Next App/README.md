## Create next app with typescript, and tailwindcss
I first created a folder with my blog project name, journey-blog, I dragged and dropped that folder into VS Code. 
I like to use yarn, so inside a terminal window in VS Code I entered this command to initialize the project.

[Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) was also helpful with this initialization, because I wanted to use 
TypeScript.

```Shell
yarn create next-app --typescript -e with-tailwindcss ./
```
